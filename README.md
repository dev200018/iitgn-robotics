HPM's Introduction to Robotics - ME 639

This is a repository for all codes written for the ME 639 - Introduction to Robotics course offered at IIT Gandhinagar in Fall 2021.

Please collaborate within your groups but either keep your working codes private (not visible to everybody) and only commit at the time of submission or upload at the time of the submission.

Once committed, everybody's code is visible to everybody else. In subsequent submissions, use of ideas from each other's codes from previous submission (which has become public) is permitted.

Each submission will be created as a separate branch.

## File purpose
1. task0.pdf : Contains all the theory
2. task1_position.py : The end effector will move to the given desired point
3. task1_line.py : End effector will follow the linear trajectory for a given slope and y-intercept of desired line
4. task1_circle.py : End effector will follow the circular trajectory for a given centre co-ordinate and radius of desired circle
5. task2.py : Return values of motor torques required to apply desired force on the wall
6. task3.py : 2R Elbow Manipulator will behave like a spring for a desired displacement of end effector and spring constant
7. task4.py : If both rod move from 35 deg. to 145 deg. what will be the possible area were end effector can reach
